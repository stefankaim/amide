	  that have same location
	* add dicom mimetype to desktop.in file [1]
	* added ability to read in DICOM files via DCMTK utilizing jpeg compression [2]

	* add support for vistaio files [3]
	* add support for libc-2.23 [3]
	* fix for compatibility with ffmpeg-2.9 [4]
	* updated autotools
	* updated copyright notices for 2017
	* fix for newer ffmpeg encoding [5]
	  note, this uses a command avcodec_encode_video2 that's already deprecated
	* for dynamic data with interframe time gaps, give preference over frame
	  start times over frame durations for adjustment into continous 4D data set [6]
	* correction of dicom quantitation, was incorrectly using scaling_intercept [7]
          dicom is y = RescaleSlope * x + RescaleIntercept.
          amide is y = scaling_factor * (x + scaling_intercept)
	  amide now divides RescaleIntercept by RescaleSlope when reading in DICOM
	* similarly, reading in from the medcon library, most file formats
	  are y = mx+b, now fixing things as amide is y = m(x+b)
